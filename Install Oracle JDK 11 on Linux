Step 1:
Download the latest JDK(jdk-11.0.14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz) from the official site.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11

Step 2:
Open the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following command.

sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm

Copy
If the /usr/lib/jvm folder does not exist, this command will create the directory. If you already have this folder, you can ignore this step and move to the next step.

Step 3:
Enter the following command to change the directory.

cd /usr/lib/jvm

Copy

Step 4:
Extract the jdk-Xuxx-linux-xXX.tar.gz file in that directory using this command.

sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/jdk-11.0.14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

Copy
According to this command, the JDK filename is jdk-11.0.14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz and which is located in the ~/Downloads folder. If your downloaded file is in any other location, change the command according to your path.

Step 5:
Enter the following command to open the environment variables file.

sudo nano /etc/environment

Copy

According to your personal preference, you can choose any text editors instead of nano.

Step 6:
In the opened file, add the following bin folder to the existing PATH variable.

/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin

Copy
The PATH variables must be separated by colon.

Add the following environment variables at the end of the file.

JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14"

Copy

The environment file before the modification:

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"

Copy
The environment file after the modification:

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin"
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14"

Copy

Save the changes and close nano (Ctrl + O, Ctrl + X).

Step 7:
Enter the following commands to inform the system about the Java's location. Depending on your JDK version, the paths can be different.

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin/java" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin/javac" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin/java

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.14/bin/javac

Copy

Step 8:
To verify the setup enter the following commands and make sure that they print the location of java and javac as you have provided in the previous step.

update-alternatives --list java

Copy

update-alternatives --list javac

Copy

Step 9:
Restart the computer (or just log-out and login) and open the terminal again.

Step 10:
Enter the following command.

java -version

Copy

If you get the installed Java version as the output, you have successfully installed the Oracle JDK in your system.
