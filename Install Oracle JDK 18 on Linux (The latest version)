Step 1:
Download the latest JDK(jdk-8u321-linux-x64.tar.gz) from this official site. 

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8

Step 2:
Open the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following command.

sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm

Copy
If the /usr/lib/jvm folder does not exist, this command will create the directory. If you already have this folder, you can ignore this step and move to next step.

Step 3:
Enter the following command to change the directory.

cd /usr/lib/jvm

Copy

Step 4:
Extract the jdk-8u321-linux-x64.tar.gz file in that directory using this command.

sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/jdk-8u321-linux-x64.tar.gz

Copy
According to this command, the JDK filename is jdk-8u321-linux-x64.tar.gz and which is located in the ~/Downloads folder. If your downloaded file is in any other location, change the command according to your path.

Step 5:
Enter the following command to open the environment variables file.

sudo gedit /etc/environment

Copy

Step 6:
In the opened file, add the following bin folders to the existing PATH variable.

/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/db/bin
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/jre/bin

Copy
The PATH variables have to be separated by a colon.
Notice that the installed JDK version is 1.8 update 321. Depending on your JDK version, the paths can be different.
Add the following environment variables at the end of the file.

J2SDKDIR="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321"
J2REDIR="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/jre"
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321"
DERBY_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/db"

Copy

The environment file before the modification:

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"

Copy
The environment file after the modification:

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/jre/bin"
J2SDKDIR="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321"
J2REDIR="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/jre"
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321"
DERBY_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/db"

Copy

Save the changes and close the gedit. To learn more about setting environment variables and/or to set the environment variable without root privilege, check How to Set Environment Variables in Linux?.

Step 7:
Enter the following commands to inform the system about the Java's location. Depending on your JDK version, the paths can be different.

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin/java" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin/javac" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin/java

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_321/bin/javac

Copy

Step 8:
To verify the setup enter the following commands and make sure that they print the location of java and javac as you have provided in the previous step.

update-alternatives --list java

Copy

update-alternatives --list javac

Copy

Step 9:
Restart the computer (or just log-out and login) and open the terminal again.

Step 10:
Enter the following command.

java -version

Copy

If you get the installed Java version as the output, you have successfully installed the Oracle JDK in your system.
